// NoteVerifier — continuous, engine-side scoring of a chart's guitar notes.
//
// The notedetect plugin used to run a renderer `setInterval` loop that called
// `audio.scoreChord` over IPC on every tick. During dense passages the renderer
// event loop is starved and the loop blacks out for 1-3 s — whole runs of notes
// are never scored. NoteVerifier moves that work into the engine: a background
// `juce::Thread` walks the pushed chart against the live playhead and scores
// each note's timing window exactly once, publishing a verdict the renderer
// just drains.
//
// Threading contract mirrors MlNoteDetector: a background thread does the work
// and publishes a snapshot guarded by a juce::CriticalSection; any non-audio
// thread (the N-API thread) polls it via drainVerdicts(). The thread reads the
// engine's input ring through AudioEngine::getInputFrame() (already designed
// for off-audio-thread reads). It never touches the audio thread directly.
//
// Playhead: the worker does NOT use AudioEngine::getBackingPosition() — that
// only advances for JUCE-routed songs, and stem-based (sloppak) songs always
// plays on the renderer's HTML5 <audio>, leaving the backing transport frozen.
// Instead the renderer pushes its own unified, already-corrected playhead via
// setPlayhead() each detect tick; the worker interpolates between pushes.
//
// Scoring: a note is a HIT when the harmonic-comb confirms its pitch present
// anywhere in its timing window (presence). Timing is taken from a separate
// spectral-flux OnsetDetector — for a picked note the nearest detected pick
// attack gives a precise strike time; legato (hammer-on / pull-off) notes have
// no attack, so they are reported on-time. The comb's 85 ms window is far too
// coarse to time an onset, hence the dedicated detector.
