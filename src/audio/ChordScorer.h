// ChordScorer — native port of the notedetect plugin's polyphonic
// chord-scoring math (slopsmith-plugin-notedetect/screen.js). Constitution
// II requires audio analysis to live in JUCE, not renderer JS; the
// renderer calls in over IPC (`audio:scoreChord`) and consumes the
// returned result object.
//
// The math is a direct C++ translation of the JS originals
// (`_ndFftMagnitude`, `_ndStringBandHz`, `_ndBandEnergy`, `_ndTotalEnergy`,
// `_ndConstraintCheckString`, `_ndScoreChord`). The custom radix-2
// Cooley-Tukey in JS is replaced with `juce::dsp::FFT`; the rest of the
// helpers are line-for-line translations. Behavioural parity with the
// browser path is the target — bin-for-bin floating-point identity is
// not, since the JS FFT and `juce::dsp::FFT` evaluate the butterflies
// in different orders and may also use vectorised intrinsics natively.
