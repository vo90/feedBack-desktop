# Sign every native binary inside resources/bin and resources/python/runtime
# with the Developer ID Application certificate so the .app passes
# notarization. Runs as part of the macOS bundle step, after binaries
# are downloaded/copied but before verify_bundled_binaries runs them
# (signing also clears the quarantine attribute that GitHub release
# downloads carry by default).
#
# Skips silently when APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY is unset — local builds
# without a Developer ID cert still produce a (Gatekeeper-rejected)
# unsigned .app, same as before this script existed.
#
# Required env (set by CI):
#   APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY  Full identity string, e.g.
#                           "Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)"
#                           Must already be present in the active keychain.
